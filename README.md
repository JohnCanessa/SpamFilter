# SpamFilter
Spam filter following the contents of a NLP book I am reading at the time.

I am currently reading and experimenting with Getting Started with Natural Language Peocessing

In chapter two a spam filter is described in detail.
I used VSCode with GitHub Copilot to write the code in this post.
The code is quite similar yet different to what is in the book.
I should compare the code examples in GitHub against the code in this post.

If interested in additional comments, I invite you to read the following
post in my blg:

Keep in mind that one of the best ways to learn is to read, experiment, and repeat.

Enjoy,
